# BRAINS

By _Team MÃ¼tli_

While we are holed away at Railscamp, a killer infestation of Zombies has broken out in Melbourne. To save the world and to get back to ADSL, we do the only thing we know how: _write Rails apps!_ Write a Rails (or Sinatra or Rack) application which controls a robot facing an impending horde of zombies. Our ability to surf YouTube depends on it.

This is a pre-release of Brains to start you thinking about writing your own Robots.

_Special thanks goes to Daniel Bogan for the amazing sprites! Also, thank you to all the people who helped at various points (Myles, Jeremy, Josh etc)._

## Install

 1. Clone repo: `git clone git://github.com/chrislloyd/brains.git`
 2. Install [Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/): `brew install redis`
 3. Install gems: `gem install redis unicorn sinatra json uuid rest-client gosu`
 4. Start Redis: `redis-server /etc/redis.conf`
 5. Start the example robot: `cd client ; unicorn -p 4567`
 6. Start the UI: `cd ui ; ui.rb`
 7. Start the server: `cd server ; ruby server.rb`

## Writing your own Robot

**Note: This API isn't totally tied down. There will definitely be further changes at Railscamp, though it's good enough to start developing against now.**

_The best way to get an understanding of how to write your own bot is to have a look at `client/dummy.rb` which is a very simple robot._

All we require to power a robot is a webserver. For the moment, it must run on [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567). The game will POST a JSON string to '/' with your robot's _current environment_. This is a hash which looks like this:

    {
      "x": 265.0,
      "y": 200.0,
      "dir": 180,
      "health": 100,
      "energy": 100
      "visible": [
        {"x": 220, "dir": 160, "y": 450, "decay": 0, "type": "zombie", "health": 100, "state": "idle"}
      ]
    }

The `x` and `y` are your position on the board and `dir` is the direction where you are looking. Your health is always out of 100. Energy is also out of 100.

Your health goes down when you are attacked by a Zombie. They do 2 damage with each attack. I'll explain energy later.

The `visible` array shows you all the things which are visible to your player. You get a 60 degree cone of sight and can see 200 pixels into the distance. In the previous example the player can see an `idle` `zombie` at (200,450).

So we POST a JSON string of this data to '/' and then you return a JSON string with what you want your Robot to do. It should look like this:

    {
      "action": "move",
      "x": 1
      "y": -1
    }

Valid actions are `idle`, `move`, `turn` and `attack`. When you turn you also have to specify a `dir` (direction) which is in degrees between 0 and 360.

Each action you make takes energy. At the moment the current energy penalties are:

    idle: 20
    move: -20
    turn: -30
    attack: -100

These, however are likely to change and you should check `server/lib/robot.rb`.
